## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    ```bash
    pip install smooth-py
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your API key">
    Get your API key from [app.smooth.sh](https://app.smooth.sh), then run:
    ```bash
    smooth config --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to OpenClaw">
    ```bash
    npx clawhub@latest install smooth-browser
    ```

    Alternatively, you can copy the [SKILL.md file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/circlemind-ai/smooth-sdk/refs/heads/master/skills/smooth-browser/SKILL.md) directly to your agent's skill folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give your agent a task">
    Ask your agent to do something on the web. It will use Smooth automatically.

    ```
    Find a one-way flight from London to NY leaving tomorrow
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** You can also give your agent complex goals. Our skill will teach it how to break them into subtasks and distribute them across multiple concurrent browser sessions automatically.
