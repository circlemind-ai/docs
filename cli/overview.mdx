## The Problem

AI agents like Claude Code are powerful, but they're mostly stuck in the terminal. Meanwhile, most valuable work happens in the browser.

Current browser tools for agents (like `--chrome`, Playwright MCP, agent-browser) all make the same mistake: **they expose low-level actions like click, type, and scroll.** This forces your agent to think about button positions instead of your actual goals.

This creates three problems:

| Problem | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Slow & expensive** | Using a massive model to click buttons is wasteful. Every action costs tokens and time. |
| **Context pollution** | Every click and keystroke fills up the context window with UI noise instead of your task. |
| **Wrong expertise** | General-purpose models aren't trained to handle iframes, shadow DOMs, and the messy reality of websites. |

## The Solution

Smooth CLI is a browser built for AI agents. Instead of exposing hundreds of low-level tools, it gives agents a simple natural language interface.

**Your agent says what it wants. Smooth figures out how to do it.**

## How It Works

Instead of this:
```
click(x=342, y=128)
type("search query")
click(x=401, y=130)
scroll(down=500)
click(x=220, y=340)
... (50 more steps)
```

Your agent just says:
```
"Search for flights from NYC to LA and find the cheapest option"
```

The agent thinks about your goals. Smooth handles the browser.
