Your agent can check websites on demand, monitor for changes, or gather status updates from various sources.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Check availability** - See if products are in stock or appointments available
- **Monitor prices** - Check current prices across multiple sites
- **Gather status** - Check dashboards, reports, or metrics
- **Verify content** - Confirm information is displaying correctly

## Example: Check Stock Availability

> "Check if the PS5 is in stock at Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart. Tell me price and availability for each."

Your agent visits all three retailers and reports back with current status.

## Example: Monitor Competitor Pricing

> "Check our three main competitors' pricing pages and tell me if anything changed from last week"

Your agent visits each site and compares to your baseline.

## Example: Check Application Status

> "Using my visa-portal profile, log in and check the status of my application. Let me know if there are any updates."

Your agent navigates the portal and reports any changes.

## Example: Gather Daily Metrics

> "Using my analytics profile, go to our Google Analytics dashboard and get yesterday's traffic numbers, top pages, and conversion rate"

Your agent pulls metrics from your authenticated dashboards.

## Example: Verify a Deployment

> "Check our production site and make sure the new banner is showing on the homepage"

Your agent verifies that recent changes are live.

## Example: Track Flight Prices

> "Check Google Flights for NYC to London on March 15th. What's the cheapest option right now?"

Your agent searches and reports current prices.

<Tip>
  For recurring checks, your agent can run the same task periodically. Just ask it again whenever you need an update.
