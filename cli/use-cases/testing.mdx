description: 'Have your agent test your web application'
---

Your agent can explore your web app, try different user flows, and report issues - like having a QA tester on demand.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Exploratory testing** - Click around and find broken things
- **User flow testing** - Walk through signup, checkout, or other critical paths
- **Visual inspection** - Check for UI issues, broken images, or layout problems
- **Cross-browser behavior** - Verify functionality works as expected

## Example: Test a User Flow

> "Go to localhost:3000, create a new account, add an item to cart, and complete checkout. Tell me if anything breaks or looks wrong."

Your agent walks through the entire flow and reports any issues encountered.

## Example: Find Broken Links

> "Go to our marketing site and check all the links on the homepage. Report any that are broken or lead to 404 pages."

Your agent systematically clicks through links and documents failures.

## Example: Test After Deployment

> "Go to staging.ourapp.com and test the new password reset flow. Try with a valid email, invalid email, and empty form. Report results."

Your agent tests edge cases and normal cases, documenting what happens.

## Example: Check Mobile Layout

> "Go to our landing page on a mobile device and check if all elements are visible and the navigation works properly."

Your agent uses mobile emulation to test responsive design.

## Example: Accessibility Spot Check

> "Go to our signup page and try to complete the form using only the keyboard. Report any issues with focus states or navigation."

Your agent tests keyboard accessibility and reports problems.

<Tip>
  Use localhost access to test against your local dev server before deploying. The agent can catch issues before they reach production.

<Note>
  Your agent provides natural language reports about what it found, not automated test results. It's exploratory testing, not assertion-based testing.
