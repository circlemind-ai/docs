Your agent can navigate complex multi-step forms, handle dropdowns and checkboxes, and submit data - saving you from repetitive data entry.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Job applications** - Fill out lengthy application forms with your details
- **Account signups** - Register for services with your information
- **Government forms** - Navigate bureaucratic portals and submissions
- **Data entry** - Input records into CRMs, databases, or admin panels

## Example: Job Application

> "Go to the Google Careers page, find Software Engineer positions in NYC, and fill out an application with my resume and these details: [your info]"

Your agent navigates the application portal, fills each field, uploads your resume, and submits.

## Example: Expense Reports

> "Using my workday profile, go to expense reports and submit these 5 receipts with descriptions: [receipt details]"

Your agent logs into Workday, creates expense entries, categorizes them, and attaches documentation.

## Example: Government Portal

> "Go to the DMV appointment scheduler, find the earliest available slot for a license renewal in my zip code, and book it"

Your agent handles the clunky government website navigation for you.

## Example: CRM Data Entry

> "Using my salesforce profile, create a new lead with these details: [contact info]. Add notes about how we met at the conference."

Your agent fills out the lead form with all the fields you specify.

## Example: Bulk Registration

> "Register for accounts on these 3 newsletter services with my email. Use these preferences: [preferences]"

Your agent handles multiple signups.

<Note>
  For forms requiring authentication, set up a profile first so your agent is already logged in.

<Tip>
  Watch via live view for sensitive forms. You can review before the agent clicks submit.
