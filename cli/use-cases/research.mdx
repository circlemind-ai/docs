description: 'Let your agent research topics across the web'
---

Your agent can browse the web, visit multiple sources, and compile research on any topic. It handles the tedious clicking and reading while you get the summarized results.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Compare products** - Research options across multiple sites and summarize findings
- **Gather market intel** - Check competitor websites, pricing pages, and news
- **Find information** - Search for specific facts across multiple sources
- **Monitor trends** - Check social media, forums, and news for mentions

## Example: Product Research

> "Research the top 5 project management tools. For each one, find the pricing, key features, and what users complain about in reviews. Give me a comparison."

Your agent visits Asana, Monday, Notion, ClickUp, and Jira - checking their pricing pages, feature lists, and review sites like G2 and Capterra.

## Example: Competitive Analysis

> "Go to our three main competitors' websites and find out what new features they've announced in the last month"

Your agent checks their blogs, changelogs, and announcement pages.

## Example: Lead Research

> "I'm meeting with Acme Corp tomorrow. Research them - find their recent news, key executives, company size, and any recent product launches"

Your agent visits their website, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and news sites to build a briefing.

## Example: Technical Research

> "Find the best practices for implementing OAuth 2.0 in a React app. Check the official docs, Stack Overflow, and any recent blog posts"

Your agent gathers information from multiple technical sources and synthesizes it.

<Tip>
  Be specific about what sources you want checked. "Research X" is broad, but "Research X by checking their website, recent news, and customer reviews on G2" gives better results.
