Your agent can access localhost and your local network through a secure tunnel. This is perfect for testing local apps, accessing internal tools, or working with development servers.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Test your local app** - Have the agent click through your dev server and report bugs
- **Access internal dashboards** - Browse admin panels and internal tools on your network
- **Fill local forms** - Submit data to your local APIs through the browser
- **Screenshot local pages** - Get visual feedback from your running application

## How It Works

When you start a session, the browser traffic is routed through your machine by default. Your agent sees exactly what you'd see if you opened the browser yourself.

```
Your Machine                    Cloud Browser
     |                               |
     |  <-- secure tunnel -->        |
     |                               |
localhost:3000            agent browses localhost:3000
```

<Note>
  The tunnel is automatic. Just give your agent a localhost URL and it works.
</Note>

## Example: Test a Local App

Ask your agent:

> "Go to localhost:3000, click through the signup flow, and tell me if there are any broken links or UI issues"

Your agent will browse your local dev server, interact with it like a real user, and report back.

## Example: Access Internal Tools

> "Go to 192.168.1.100:8080/admin, check the system status dashboard, and summarize any warnings"

Your agent can access anything on your local network that your machine can reach.

## Disabling the Tunnel

If you don't need local access and want the browser to use its own IP, tell your agent to use the `--no-proxy` flag when starting the session.
