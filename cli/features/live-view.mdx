description: 'See exactly what your agent sees in real-time'

Every session comes with a live view URL where you can watch your agent browse in real-time. You can also take over and interact with the browser yourself.

## What You Can Do

- **Watch progress** - See your agent navigate, click, and type in real-time
- **Debug issues** - See exactly where things go wrong when a task fails
- **Take over** - Manually handle a step the agent can't (like a CAPTCHA)
- **Verify actions** - Confirm the agent is doing what you expect before it continues

## How It Works

When a session starts, you get a live URL:

```
Session started successfully!
Session ID: abc123
Live URL: https://live.smooth.sh/v/...
```

Open that URL in your browser to watch and interact.

## Example: Supervise a Sensitive Task

> "Using my bank profile, go to my account and check my balance. I'll watch via live view."

You monitor the live view as the agent navigates your banking site, ready to intervene if needed.

## Example: Handle a CAPTCHA

The agent encounters a CAPTCHA it can't solve:

1. You see it in the live view
2. You solve the CAPTCHA manually
3. The agent continues where it left off

## Example: Verify Before Submitting

> "Fill out the insurance claim form with these details. Stop before submitting so I can review."

You check the live view to verify the form is correct, then tell the agent to submit.

<Tip>
  The live view is interactive. You can click, type, and scroll - the agent will see your changes and can continue from there.

<Note>
  Live views are session-specific and expire when the session closes. Share them only with people you trust.
