Browser profiles save your login state so your agent can access authenticated content. Log in once manually, then your agent can work with that account indefinitely.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Check your email** - Read and summarize messages from Gmail, Outlook, etc.
- **Manage social media** - Post updates, check notifications, respond to messages
- **Access work tools** - Use Jira, Notion, Salesforce, or any SaaS you're logged into
- **Monitor dashboards** - Check analytics, reports, and admin panels

## How It Works

1. Create a profile and log in manually through the live view
2. Your authentication (cookies, sessions) is saved to that profile
3. Future sessions with the same profile are already logged in

Your credentials stay on your machine and in the secure profile storage. The agent never sees your password.

## Example: Check LinkedIn Messages

First session - log in manually:

> "Start a session with my linkedin profile and go to linkedin.com. I'll log in."

You log in through the live view URL. Cookies are saved.

Next time - already authenticated:

> "Using my linkedin profile, check my messages and summarize any from recruiters this week"

Your agent is already logged in and can access your messages immediately.

## Example: Post to Social Media

> "Using my twitter profile, draft a tweet about our new product launch and show me a preview before posting"

Your agent uses your saved Twitter session to compose the tweet.

## Example: Check Work Dashboard

> "Using my salesforce profile, go to my deals dashboard and tell me which deals are closing this week"

Your agent accesses Salesforce with your saved authentication.

<Note>
  You control when to log in and what accounts to save. The agent only uses profiles you've explicitly set up.
