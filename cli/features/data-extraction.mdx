Your agent can extract structured data from any webpage and return it in a format you can work with. No parsing HTML, no writing selectors - just describe what you want.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Scrape product listings** - Get prices, names, and details from e-commerce sites
- **Extract contact info** - Pull emails, phone numbers, and addresses from directories
- **Gather research data** - Collect information from multiple sources into structured tables
- **Parse search results** - Turn search engine results into actionable data

## Example: Extract Search Results

Ask your agent:

> "Search Google for 'best restaurants in Austin' and extract the top 10 results with name, rating, and address"

Your agent returns structured data:

```json
[
  {"name": "Franklin Barbecue", "rating": 4.8, "address": "900 E 11th St"},
  {"name": "Uchi", "rating": 4.7, "address": "801 S Lamar Blvd"},
  ...
]
```

## Example: Scrape a Product Page

> "Go to this Amazon product page and extract the title, price, rating, and number of reviews"

```json
{
  "title": "Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones",
  "price": 328.00,
  "rating": 4.6,
  "reviews": 12847
}
```

## Example: Gather Competitive Intelligence

> "Go to our three main competitors' pricing pages and extract all their plan names and prices"

Your agent visits multiple sites and returns consolidated data you can compare.

## How Extraction Works

1. Your agent navigates to the page (or you provide a URL)
2. You describe what data you want in plain English
3. The agent analyzes the page and extracts matching information
4. Data is returned in a structured format

<Tip>
  Be specific about what fields you want. "Extract the products" is okay, but "Extract product name, price, and availability" gets better results.
