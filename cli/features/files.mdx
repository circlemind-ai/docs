Your agent can work with files in both directions - you can give it files to upload to websites, and it can download files from the web for you.

## What Your Agent Can Do

- **Fill forms with attachments** - Upload resumes, documents, or images to web forms
- **Download reports** - Grab PDFs, spreadsheets, or exports from dashboards
- **Process documents** - Give the agent a file and have it upload it somewhere
- **Collect assets** - Download images, files, or exports from multiple sources

## Uploading Files

Give your agent a local file to use during its session:

> "Here's my resume (resume.pdf). Go to the company careers page and apply for the Software Engineer position"

Your agent uploads your resume to the job application form.

> "Upload this invoice (invoice.pdf) to the expense reporting system and categorize it as 'Travel'"

Your agent fills out the expense form with your document attached.

## Downloading Files

Your agent can download files and make them available to you:

> "Go to our analytics dashboard, generate a report for last month, and download it"

> "Find the latest SEC 10-K filing for Apple and download it"

> "Go to the Google Slides presentation at this URL and download it as a PDF"

After the session, you can retrieve downloaded files from the session.

## Example: Bulk Document Processing

> "For each of these 5 contracts in my folder, upload them to the DocuSign portal and send for signature to legal@company.com"

Your agent processes each file, handling the uploads and form filling.
