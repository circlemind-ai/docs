## Overview

Custom extensions allow you to load your own Chrome extensions into the browser session. This is useful adding guardrails, taking determistic actions, or for testing extensions.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# pip install smooth-py
from smooth import SmoothClient

smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Upload a custom extension (must be a .zip file)
extension = smooth_client.upload_extension(file=open("comic-sans-extension.zip", "rb"))

# Get the extension ID
extension_id = extension.id

# Use the extension in a task
task = smooth_client.run(
    "Navigate to example.com and take a screenshot",
    extensions=[extension_id]
)

# List all uploaded extensions
extensions = smooth_client.list_extensions()
for ext in extensions:
    print(f"Extension ID: {ext.id}")

# Delete extension
smooth_client.delete_extension(extension_id)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Extensions must be packaged as Chrome extension .zip files with a valid manifest.json. The extension will be loaded into the browser session and remain active for the duration of the task.
</Note>

## Extension Lifecycle

Extensions are uploaded to Smooth servers and can be reused across multiple tasks. Use `.delete_extension()` to permanently delete it.

```python
# Upload once
extension = smooth_client.upload_extension(file=open("my-extension.zip", "rb"))

# Use multiple times
task1 = smooth_client.run("Task 1", extensions=[extension.id])
task2 = smooth_client.run("Task 2", extensions=[extension.id])

# Delete extension
smooth_client.delete_extension(extension.id)
```

## Multiple Extensions

You can load multiple extensions in a single session by passing a list of extension IDs:

```python
extension1 = smooth_client.upload_extension(file=open("extension1.zip", "rb"))
extension2 = smooth_client.upload_extension(file=open("extension2.zip", "rb"))

task = smooth_client.run(
    "Your task here",
    extensions=[extension1.id, extension2.id]
)
```
