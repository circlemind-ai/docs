## Overview

The following demonstrates how to instruct Smooth to handle custom data files.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# pip install smooth-py
from smooth import SmoothClient

smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
file_handle = client.upload_file(open("README.md", "rb"))
task = smooth_client.run("Upload the given file to https://www.azurespeed.com/Azure/UploadLargeFile to test the upload speed.", files=[file_handle.id])

...
```

</CodeGroup>

Files can be reused across multiple tasks but are automatically deleted from our servers after 24 hours.
If you want to manually delete a file when it is no longer necessary, you can use `.delete_file`.

<Note>
Smooth has access to the file content and can analyze it if requested. Be careful when dealing with sensitive data.
