## Overview

The following demonstrates how to instruct Smooth to handle custom data files.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

# 1. Upload the file
file = client.upload_file(open("report.pdf", "rb"))

# 2. Use it in a task
result = client.run(
    task="Upload this report to the portal",
    files=[file.id]
)

# 3. Or use it in a session
with client.session(files=[file.id]) as session:
    session.run_task("Analyze the uploaded report")
```

</CodeGroup>

Files can be reused across multiple tasks but are automatically deleted from our servers after 24 hours.
If you want to manually delete a file when it is no longer necessary, you can use `.delete_file`.

<Note>
Smooth has access to the file content and can analyze it if requested. Be careful when dealing with sensitive data.
