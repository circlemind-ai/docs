## Overview

Proxies act as intermediaries between Smooth and the internet. They can help you bypass restrictions and enhance stealth mode. 
Using proxies with Smooth allows you to run tasks from a different IP address, which can be useful for web scraping and automation tasks.

## Benefits of Using Proxies

1. **Stealth**: Proxies can be used to enhance stealth mode.
2. **Intranet**: Access content that is only available within your company's intranet.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple proxies to avoid hitting rate limits on target websites.

## Using Proxies with Smooth

To use a proxy with Smooth, you need to specify the proxy server details in your task parameters. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
task = smooth_client.run(
  task="<my-task>",
  proxy_server="<my-proxy-url>",
  proxy_username="<my-proxy-username>",
  proxy_password="<my-proxy-password>",
)

print(f"Live URL: {task(.live_url())}")
print(f"Agent response: {task.result()}")
```

</CodeGroup>
