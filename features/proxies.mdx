## Overview

Proxies act as intermediaries between Smooth and the internet. They can help you bypass restrictions and enhance stealth mode. 
Using proxies with Smooth allows you to run tasks from a different IP address, which can be useful for web scraping and automation tasks.

## Benefits of Using Proxies

1. **Stealth**: Proxies can be used to enhance stealth mode.
2. **Intranet**: Access content that is only available within your company's intranet.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple proxies to avoid hitting rate limits on target websites.

## Using Proxies with Smooth

To use a proxy with Smooth, you can specify the proxy server details when running a task or opening a session.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

# 1. Using the run shortcut
result = client.run(
  task="Check my IP on icanhazip.com",
  proxy_server="http://proxy.example.com:8080",
  proxy_username="my_username",
  proxy_password="my_password",
)
print(result.output)

# 2. Within a session
with client.session(
    proxy_server="http://proxy.example.com:8080",
    proxy_username="my_username",
    proxy_password="my_password"
) as session:
    result = session.run_task("Check my IP")
    print(result.output)
```
