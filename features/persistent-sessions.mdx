## Overview

Browser profiles allow you to persist cookies and authentication across runs.
Once a profile is created, it can be utilized for running agent tasks that require user authentication.

1. **Create a Profile**
Open a new browser session. The system will return a profile_id (a unique identifier for your profile) and a live_url (an interactive browser window).
2. **Authenticate via the Live URL**
Navigate to the provided live_url to log in to the target platform (e.g., your project management tool, social media account) as you normally would. This action securely stores the session authentication cookies within the profile.
3. **Execute Tasks with the Profile ID**
When running an agent task, simply include the profile_id. The agent will use the stored authentication from that profile, allowing it to immediately access the platform as a logged-in user.
