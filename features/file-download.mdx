## Overview

The following demonstrates how to instruct Smooth to download and return files from the web.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# pip install smooth-py
from smooth import SmoothClient

smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
task = smooth_client.run("Go to https://pdfobject.com/examples/passing-element-styled.html and download the pdf file.")

print(f"Agent response: {task.result()}")
print(f"Downloaded file archive URL: {task.downloads_url()}")
```

</CodeGroup>

Downloaded files are automatically deleted from our servers after 24 hours.

<Note>
Smooth has access to the file content and can analyze it if requested. Be careful when dealing with sensitive data.
