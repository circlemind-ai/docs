## Overview

The following demonstrates how to instruct Smooth to download and return files from the web.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

# 1. Using the run shortcut
result = client.run("Go to https://example.com/report.pdf and download it")

print(f"Agent response: {result.output}")
print(f"Downloaded files: {result.downloads_url}")

# 2. Within a session
with client.session() as session:
    session.run_task("Download the report")

# After session closes, get aggregated results
final_result = session.result()
print(f"Downloaded files: {final_result.downloads_url}")
```

</CodeGroup>

Downloaded files are automatically deleted from our servers after 24 hours.

<Note>
Smooth has access to the file content and can analyze it if requested. Be careful when dealing with sensitive data.
