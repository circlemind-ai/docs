## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Smooth to search for flights using Google Flights.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Search Parameters">
    Structure your flight search task prompt.

    ```python Python
    flight_search = """
    Search for flights on Google Flights from New York to London, departing tomorrow, coming back in a week. Find the cheapest round-trip option and return:
    - Flight details (airline, flight number, times)
    - Price, duration, and number of stops
    """
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute Flight Search">
    Run your flight search task.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cm-YOUR_API_KEY")
    
    task = smooth_client.run(
        task=flight_search,
        enable_recording=True
    )

    print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
    task_result = task.result()
    print(f"Agent Response: {task_result.output}")
    print(f"Task Video: {task_result.recording_url()}")
    ```

    The agent will navigate Google Flights, input your search criteria, and analyze the results to find the best option.
