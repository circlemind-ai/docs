## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to scrape data from websites that require user authentication by using persistent browser sessions. You'll learn to launch a browser session, authenticate manually, and then run automated tasks using that authenticated session.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Browser Session">
    First, create a new browser session that will persist your authentication cookies. This session will return a `session_id` and `live_url` for manual authentication.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
    session = smooth_client.open_session(session_id="gmail-session")

    print(f"Live URL: {session.live_url()}")
    print(f"Session ID: {session.session_id}")
    ```

    The `live_url` opens an interactive browser window where you can manually authenticate.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate Manually">
    Open the `live_url` in your browser and manually log in to Gmail:

    1. Navigate to the live URL provided by the session
    2. Go to gmail.com in the browser
    3. Enter your email address and password
    4. Complete any two-factor authentication if required
    5. Verify you're successfully logged in to your Gmail inbox

    Your authentication cookies are now securely stored in the session and will persist for future tasks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Automated Task">
    Now use the authenticated session to run an automated task. The agent will access Gmail as a logged-in user and retrieve your last email.

    ```python Python
    task = smooth_client.run(
        task="Go to Gmail and get the subject and sender of the most recent email in my inbox",
        session_id="gmail-session"
    )

    print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
    result = task.result()
    print(f"Last email details: {result}")
    ```

    The agent will automatically use the stored authentication from your session to access Gmail and extract the requested information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Benefits

- **Persistent Authentication**: Sessions maintain login state across multiple tasks
- **Manual Control**: You handle the authentication process manually for security
- **Automated Execution**: Once authenticated, agents can run complex tasks automatically
- **Session Reuse**: The same session can be used for multiple related tasks

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive session IDs for better organization
- Keep sessions secure and don't share session IDs
- Test authentication manually before running automated tasks
- Handle rate limits and be respectful to the target website

<Note>
  Sessions persist cookies and authentication state, making them perfect for accessing protected content while maintaining security through manual authentication.
