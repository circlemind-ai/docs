## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to scrape data from websites that require user authentication. You'll learn how to create a **Browser Profile**, log in once, and reuse that profile for automated tasks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Browser Profile">
    First, create a persistent profile that will store your authentication cookies.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
    profile = client.create_profile(profile_id="my-secure-session")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate Manually">
    Open a session using your new profile and use the `live_url` to log in manually.

    ```python Python
    with client.session(profile_id="my-secure-session") as session:
        print(f"Log in here: {session.live_url()}")
        # Keep the session open until you finish logging in
        input("Press Enter once you have logged in successfully...")
    ```

    1. Open the `live_url` in your local browser.
    2. Log in to the target service (e.g., LinkedIn, Gmail).
    3. Complete any 2FA requirements.
    4. Once you see your dashboard, close the tab or press Enter in your terminal.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Automated Tasks">
    Now you can run automated tasks using the authenticated profile. The agent will start as a logged-in user.

    ```python Python
    # Use the same profile_id
    with client.session(profile_id="my-secure-session") as session:
        result = session.run_task("Summarize my most recent notifications")
        print(result.result)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Benefits

- **Persistent Authentication**: Profiles maintain login state across multiple sessions.
- **Security**: You handle the login manually, so the agent never sees your password.
- **Efficiency**: No need to handle complex automation for login forms or 2FA.
- **Workflow Continuity**: Move between manual control and autonomous execution seamlessly.

<Note>
  Browser profiles are saved automatically. You can reuse the same `profile_id` as many times as you need.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive profile IDs for better organization
- Keep profiles secure and don't share profile IDs
- Test authentication manually before running automated tasks
- Handle rate limits and be respectful to the target website

<Note>
  Browser profiles persist cookies and authentication state, making them perfect for accessing protected content while maintaining security through manual authentication.
