## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Smooth to fill in complex, multi-step forms. You'll learn how to structure the task prompt for these tasks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write the task instruction">
    Write detailed instructions that tell the agent exactly what to do. The best practice for form filling is to structure the prompt in 3 parts:
    1. The goal
    2. All information needed to fill-in the form
    3. The expected output

    ```python Python
    task_instructions = """
    Go to octopus.energy and get a quote for gas + electricity. Use the following information:
    
    - 1, Garlic Row, Cambridge CB5 8HW
    - Medium consumption

    Return the final monthly estimate for all available tariffs.
    """
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the task">
    Run the task with a higher number of steps.

    ```python Python
    task = smooth_client.run(
        task=task_instructions,
        max_steps=64,  # Multi-step forms may require many steps
    )

    print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
    
    # Get the result
    result = task.result()
    print(f"Insurance quote result: {result}")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done!">
    The agent will adapt to the form's structure, whether it's a single long page or multiple sequential steps, and handle dynamic fields that appear based on previous selections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Benefits

- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Agent handles forms that change based on user input
- **Multi-Step Navigation**: Seamlessly moves through complex form sequences
- **Error Recovery**: Can handle validation errors and retry with corrected information

## Best Practices
- **Give Clear Default Instructions**: Specify how to handle missing information scenarios
- **Set Adequate Step Limits**: Multi-step forms often require more steps than simple tasks
- **Include Guidance**: If needed, tell the agent how to handle common pitfalls

## Common Use Cases
You can use this approach for automating a variety of tasks, such as:
- Transfering data across systems
- Getting quotes
- Submitting forms
