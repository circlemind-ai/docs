## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Smooth to upload files to websites.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload the file">
    You can use the `upload_file()` method to upload files that you will pass on to Smooth.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

    file = smooth_client.upload_file(
      name="meaningful_file_name.png", 
      file=open("/path/to/file.png", "rb")
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      When uploading multiple files, we recommend using meaningful file names to help Smooth disambiguate their content.
    </Note>

    <Note>
      Files are automatically removed after 24 hours.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the task">
    Run your task using the `files` parameter.

    ```python Python
    task = smooth_client.run(
        task="Give me an alt text for this image",
        url="https://pallyy.com/tools/alt-text-generator",
        files=[file.id]
    )

    print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
    task_result = task.result()
    print(f"Agent Response: {task_result.output}")
    print(f"Task Video: {task_result.recording_url()}")
    ```

    The agent will navigate to the website, upload the file, and return the alt text.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices
- **Use Descriptive File Names**: Choose meaningful names for your files to make it easier to identify their content later.
- **Check File Size Limits**: Ensure your files do not exceed the maximum size limits set by the platform you are uploading to.
- **Include File Types**: When specifying a file name, make sure to include the file extension, such as `.pdf` or `.png`
