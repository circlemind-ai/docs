## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Smooth for automated QA testing. You'll learn to create comprehensive test scenarios that validate user workflows, form submissions, and application functionality.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Test Scenarios">
    Structure your QA test with clear validation criteria. Define what constitutes success and failure for each test case.

    ```python Python
    test_scenario = """
    Test this flow on apple.com:
    
    1. Navigate to the apple website
    2. Go to the page to buy the latest iphone
    3. Select the basic configuration, black, maximum storage
    4. No trade in
    5. Return the price options
    """
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Comprehensive Tests">
    Execute your test scenario.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
    
    task = smooth_client.run(
        task=test_scenario,
        enable_recording=True  # For QA testing, we recommend enabling recording for later analysis
    )

    print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
    task_result = task.result()
    print(f"Agent Response: {task_result.output}")
    print(f"Task Video: {task_result.recording_url}")
    ```

    The agent will systematically execute each test step and provide the requested information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Edge Cases">
    Test boundary conditions and error handling by creating scenarios with invalid inputs or unusual user behavior.

    ```python Python
    edge_case_test = """
    Test form validation on https://github.com/signup:
    
    1. Try submitting with empty required fields
    2. Enter invalid email formats (test@, @example.com, plain text)
    3. Verify error messages are clear and helpful
    
    Report any issues. If none, just say it.
    """
    
    task = smooth_client.run(task=edge_case_test, max_steps=24)
    task_result = task.result()
    print(f"Agent Response: {task_result.output}")
    print(f"Task Video: {task_result.recording_url}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Benefits

- **Automated Regression Testing**: Run consistent tests across application updates
- **Test Responsive Behavior**: Verify functionality across different screen sizes
- **User Experience Verification**: Validate complete user journeys from start to finish
- **Error Detection**: Identify UI bugs, broken links, and form validation issues

## Best Practices

- **Write Detailed Test Cases**: Include specific validation criteria and expected outcomes
- **Test User Journeys**: Focus on complete workflows rather than isolated features
- **Document Failures Clearly**: Capture videos for later analysis

## Common QA Test Types

You can automate various testing scenarios:
- **Functional Testing**: Verify features work as intended
- **Form Validation**: Test input validation and error handling
- **Navigation Testing**: Ensure all links and menus function correctly

<Note>
  QA testing with Smooth provides real browser interaction, making it ideal for testing web applications and complex user interfaces that traditional testing tools might miss.
