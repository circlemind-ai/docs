## Overview

This guide shows how to use Smooth to extract information from government portals. You'll learn to automate the search and extraction of financial data from complex government websites, perfect for financial analysis, compliance research, and due diligence.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search SEC Filings">
    Navigate to the SEC's EDGAR database and search for a specific company's filings.

    ```python Python
    sec_search_task = """
    Go to https://www.sec.gov/search-filings and search for "Apple Inc".
    
    Find their most recent 10-K filing.
    
    Extract:
    - Filing date
    - Document title
    - Total net sales figure for the most recent fiscal year

    Return the extracted info.
    """
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute SEC Search">
    Run the search task to find Apple's latest 10-K filing.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
    
    task = smooth_client.run(
        task=sec_search_task,
        enable_recording=True
    )

    print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
    task_result = task.result()
    print(f"Agent Response: {task_result.output}")
    print(f"Task Video: {task.recording_url()}")
    ```

    The agent will navigate to the SEC portal, perform the search, identify the most recent 10-K filing, and extract the total net sales.
  </Step>
