## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Smooth to automate sending a LinkedIn connection. You'll learn to authenticate to LinkedIn via a live URL and then run automated tasks to connect with specific professionals.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Session and Authenticate">
    Create a session with a profile ID for LinkedIn. The profile will persist your authentication cookies.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    client = SmoothClient()

    with client.session(profile_id="linkedin-automation", url="https://www.linkedin.com") as session:
        # Get the live URL for manual authentication
        print(f"Please log in at: {session.live_url()}")

        # Wait for user to authenticate
        input("Press Enter after you've logged in to LinkedIn...")

        # Now run tasks in the authenticated session
        result = session.run_task(
            task="""
            Search for "Antonio Vespoli Circlemind" on LinkedIn.
            Find his profile and send a connection request with the message:
            "Hi Antonio, I love Smooth. Would love to connect!"
            """
        )

        print(f"Agent response: {result.output}")
    ```

    Open the `live_url` in your browser and log in to LinkedIn. Once authenticated, press Enter to continue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reuse the Profile">
    In future runs, use the same profile ID to skip manual authentication.

    ```python Python
    with client.session(profile_id="linkedin-automation", url="https://www.linkedin.com/feed") as session:
        result = session.run_task(
            task="Like the first 3 posts"
        )

        print(f"Agent response: {result.output}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Use Cases

- **Bulk Connections**: Connect with multiple professionals in your industry
- **Content Engagement**: Automatically like and comment on posts from your network on Twitter, Linkedin, and more
- **Lead Generation**: Find and connect with potential customers or partners
- **Profile Management**: Update your status, share content, or manage your profile

## Best Practices

- **Respect Rate Limits**: LinkedIn has strict limits on daily connection requests
- **Respect Website Terms**: Use your best judgment to respect the website Terms of Service.

<Note>
  Always follow LinkedIn's Terms of Service and use automation responsibly. Manual authentication ensures compliance with security policies while enabling powerful automation capabilities.
