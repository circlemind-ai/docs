## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Smooth to automate sending a LinkedIn connection. You'll learn to manually authenticate to LinkedIn and then run automated tasks to connect with specific professionals.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch LinkedIn Session">
    Create a new browser profile for LinkedIn that will persist your authentication cookies. This approach ensures secure access while maintaining your login state.

    ```python Python
    from smooth import SmoothClient

    smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
    session = smooth_client.open_session(profile_id="linkedin-automation")

    print(f"Live URL: {session.live_url()}")
    print(f"Session ID: {session.profile_id()}")
    ```

    The `live_url` provides an interactive browser window for manual authentication.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate to LinkedIn">
    Open the `live_url` in your browser and manually log in to LinkedIn:

    1. Navigate to the live URL provided by the session
    2. Go to linkedin.com in the browser
    3. Enter your LinkedIn email and password
    4. Complete any security verification if prompted
    5. Verify you're successfully logged into your LinkedIn home feed

    Your authentication cookies are now stored in the profile for automated tasks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automate Connection Request">
    Use the authenticated profile to automatically find and connect with Antonio Vespoli from Circlemind.

    ```python Python
    connection_task = """
    Search for "Antonio Vespoli Circlemind" on LinkedIn. Find his profile and send a connection request with the message: "Hi Antonio, I love Smooth. Would love to connect!"
    """

    task = smooth_client.run(
        task=connection_task,
        profile_id="linkedin-automation",
        enable_recording=True
    )

    print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
    result = task.result()
    print(f"Agent Response: {result.output}")
    print(f"Task video: {result.recording_url}")
    ```

    The agent will search LinkedIn, locate Antonio's profile, and send a personalized connection request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Use Cases

- **Bulk Connections**: Connect with multiple professionals in your industry
- **Content Engagement**: Automatically like and comment on posts from your network on Twitter, Linkedin, and more
- **Lead Generation**: Find and connect with potential customers or partners
- **Profile Management**: Update your status, share content, or manage your profile

## Best Practices

- **Respect Rate Limits**: LinkedIn has strict limits on daily connection requests

<Note>
  Always follow LinkedIn's Terms of Service and use automation responsibly. Manual authentication ensures compliance with security policies while enabling powerful automation capabilities.
