Start using Circlemind to store and retrieve memories within minutes.

## Python SDK

### Step 1: Install the Python SDK
```bash
pip install circlemind
```

### Step 2: Authentication
Circlemind requires an API key. If you don't have an API key, visit [app.circlemind.co](https://app.circlemind.co) to obtain one.

Once you have an API key, export it as an environment variable in your terminal.

```
export CIRCLEMIND_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Step 3: Usage
```python
from circlemind import Circlemind

# Initialize the client
client = Circlemind()

# Add a memory
client.add("Sophie enjoys hiking in the Italian Alps.")

# Query memories
res = client.query("Where does Sophie like to hike?")
print(res.response)
```
