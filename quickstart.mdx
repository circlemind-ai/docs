## Install Smooth
Smooth has both a Python and a Typescript SDK.
The Typescript SDK is automatically generate from the Python SDK and provides the same interface.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install smooth-py
```

```bash Typescript
npm installl @circlemind-ai/smooth-ts
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  To directly interface with the APIs, refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.smooth.sh/api-reference/introduction)
</Note>

## Run your first task
Submit a task in seconds. `client.run()` is the simplest way to get started.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
task = client.run("Go to google flights and find the cheapest flight from London to Paris today")

print(f"Live URL: {task.live_url()}")
print(f"Agent response: {task.result()}")
```

```typescript Typescript
import { SmoothClient } from "@circlemind-ai/smooth-ts";

const client = new SmoothClient({
  api_key: "cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const task = await client.run({
  task: "Go to google flights and find the cheapest flight from London to Paris today",
})

console.log("Live URL:", await task.live_url())
console.log("Agent response:", await task.result())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Advanced Flow: Using Sessions

For more complex workflows, such as those requiring multiple tasks in the same browser or manual interactions, use the **Session** interface.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Sessions provide a context manager for complex workflows
with client.session() as session:
    session.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com")
    session.run_task("Tell me the top story")
    
    # You can keep using the same browser session!
    session.run_task("Now find the second story and compare them")
    
    print(f"Final Result: {session.result()}")
```

</CodeGroup>
