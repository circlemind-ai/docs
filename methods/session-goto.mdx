description: 'Navigate to a URL deterministically'
---

Navigate to a specific URL deterministically. Use this when you know exactly where you need to go, rather than asking the agent to navigate.

## Usage

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient()

with client.session() as session:
    result = session.goto("https://example.com/products")
    print(f"Navigation took {result.duration} seconds")

    session.run_task("Click on the first product")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Request

<ResponseField name="url" type="string" required>
  The URL to navigate to.

  Example: `https://example.com/login`
</ResponseField>

## Response

Returns an object with the following attributes.

<ResponseField name="credits_used" type="float">
  Always `0`. Navigation is free.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="duration" type="float">
  The duration in seconds taken to perform the navigation.
</ResponseField>

## Examples

**Navigate and extract data:**

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
with client.session() as session:
    session.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com")

    stories = session.extract(
        schema={
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "title": {"type": "string"},
                    "url": {"type": "string"},
                    "points": {"type": "integer"}
                }
            }
        },
        prompt="Extract the top 5 stories"
    )

    for story in stories.output:
        print(f"{story['title']} ({story['points']} points)")
```
