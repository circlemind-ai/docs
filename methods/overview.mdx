Smooth provides two ways to automate browser tasks, each suited for different use cases:

- **Simple Task** — Run a task with a single method call. No session management required.
- **Session Workflow** — Multi-step execution where you can orchestrate smaller tasks, navigate to URLs, and extract data within a persistent browser session.

## Simple Task

The simplest way to run a browser automation. Give Smooth a task, and the agent handles everything autonomously.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient()
task = client.run("Find the cheapest flight from NYC to LA")
print(task.result())
```

</CodeGroup>

**Characteristics:**
- One-shot execution
- Agent handles navigation and actions autonomously
- Best for standalone tasks and quick automations

## Session Workflow

For complex workflows, create a browser session and orchestrate multiple steps. This gives you fine-grained control and higher reliability by breaking tasks into smaller, composable actions.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient()

with client.session() as session:
    session.run_task("Search for flights from NYC to LA leaving tomorrow")
    results = session.extract(FlightSchema)
    session.run_task("Select the cheapest option")
```

</CodeGroup>

**Characteristics:**
- Break big tasks into smaller, reliable tasks
- Mix deterministic actions (goto) with agent tasks (run_task)
- Extract structured data at any point in the workflow
- Best for complex workflows requiring higher reliability
- Great for multi-turn integrations in agents

<Tip>
  Under the hood, `client.run()` is a convenient shorthand that creates a session, runs a single task, and returns the result.
