  Browser sessions last 5 minutes and consume 1 credit ($0.01).

## What are Sessions?

Sessions allow you to interact with browser profiles to setup persistent cookies and authentication across runs.
Once a profile is created, it can be utilized for running agent tasks that require user authentication.

1. **Create a Profile**
Open a new session. The system will return a profile_id (a unique identifier for your profile), and, if requested, a live_url (to interact with the remote browser window) and a live_id (used to close the browser session and save changes).
2. **Authenticate via the Live URL**
Use the provided live_url to log in to any target platform (e.g., your project management tool, social media account) as you normally would. This action securely stores your authentication cookies within the profile.
3. **Execute Tasks with the Profile ID**
When running an agent task, simply include the profile_id. The agent will use the stored authentication from that profile, allowing it to immediately access the platform as a logged-in user.

## Open a browser session using the Python SDK

Open a browser session and create a profile in 4 lines of code.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
session = smooth_client.open_session(profile_id="my-test-session")

print(f"Live URL: {session.live_url()}")
print(f"Profile ID: {session.profile_id()}")

# Manually interact with the browser to log in into any desired services
# ...

# The profile is saved automatically when the 5 minutes time limit is reached.
# You can also do that programmatically as follows:
smooth_client.close_session(session.live_id())  # Close session and save the browser profile
```

## Parameters

All parameters available when opening a browser session. 

<ResponseField name="profile_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier for the browser profile. If omitted, a random profile ID will be generated and returned.

  This id will be used when running a task.
  
  Example: `my-test-profile`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="live_view" type="boolean">
  Request a live URL to interact with the browser session. Default: `True`.

  Set it to `True` if you want to manually interact with the browser to perform logins or other authentications.
  Set it to `False` if you want to simply create an empty browser profile for Smooth to interact with in future tasks.
</ResponseField>

## Response

Returns a `BrowserSessionHandle` with the following attributes.

<ResponseField name="profile_id()" type="method">
  Returns ID of the session.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="live_url()" type="method">
  Returns a live URL where you can interact with the browser (requires `live_view=True`).

  Set `interactive=True` to get an interactive view. 
  
  Set `embed=True` to get an embeddable view (ideal for iframes).
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="live_id()" type="method">
  Returns the live ID for the browser session. It can be passed to `close_session` to close the session and save the browser profile.
  
  <Note>
    If the browser session is not manually closed, the profile is saved automatically when the 5 minutes time limit is reached.
  </Note>
