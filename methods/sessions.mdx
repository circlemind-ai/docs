  Browser sessions consume credits based on duration and agent activity.

## What are Sessions?

Sessions are the core of Smooth. They provide a persistent browser environment where you can execute multiple tasks, navigate manually, or interact directly with the page using JavaScript.

Instead of running isolated tasks, you can open a session and:
1. **Execute multiple steps**: Run several `run_task()` calls sequentially.
2. **Direct Browser Control**: Use `goto()`, `evaluate_js()`, and `extract()` for fine-grained control.
3. **Manual Interaction**: Access the `live_url()` to perform manual logins or checks.
4. **Persistent State**: Use a `profile_id` to maintain cookies and authentication across different sessions.

## Using Sessions

The recommended way to use sessions is via a context manager, which ensures the session is properly closed when you are done. If you don't use a context manager, you must call `session.close()` manually, otherwise the session will remain active until its internal timeout is reached.

### Synchronous Usage

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Open a session (optionally with a profile for persistence)
with client.session(profile_id="my-session") as session:
    # 1. Navigate to a page
    session.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com")

    # 2. Run an automated task
    # Note: run_task preserves browser state but starts with a fresh agent memory.
    # It returns the result directly.
    result = session.run_task("Find the top story and return its summary")
    
    # 3. Use information from the previous task result
    session.run_task(f"The previous story was '{result.output}'. Now find the second story and compare them.")

# After the session is closed, you can access the recording and download urls
print(f"Recording URL: {session.recording_url()}")
print(f"Downloads URL: {session.downloads_url()}")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Asynchronous Usage (Recommended)

When using the `SmoothAsyncClient`, you don't need to use the client itself as a context manager.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import asyncio
from smooth import SmoothAsyncClient

async def main():
    client = SmoothAsyncClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")
    
    # Use the session as a context manager
    async with await client.session() as session:
        await session.goto("https://google.com")
        result = await session.run_task("Find the weather in London")
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  `client.run(task)` is a convenient shortcut for `with client.session() as session: session.run_task(task)`.
</Note>

## Session Parameters

These parameters are passed to `client.session()` to configure the browser environment.

<ResponseField name="profile_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier for the browser profile. Use this to persist cookies and logins.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="profile_read_only" type="boolean">
  If `True`, the profile will be loaded in read-only mode. Changes made during the session will not be saved back to the profile. Default: `False`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="url" type="string">
  The starting URL for the session.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="device" type="string">
  The device type used for the session: `mobile` (default) or `desktop`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="proxy_server" type="string">
  Proxy server address (e.g., `proxy.example.com`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="enable_recording" type="boolean">
  Enable video recording of the session. Default: `True`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="stealth_mode" type="boolean">
  Run the browser in stealth mode to avoid detection.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="custom_tools" type="list">
  A list of custom tools to register for the duration of the session.
</ResponseField>

## Session Methods (SessionHandle)

Once you have a `session` object, you can call the following methods.

<ResponseField name="run_task" type="method">
  Executes an autonomous agent task within the session.
  
  **Parameters:**
  - `task` (str): The task description.
  - `max_steps` (int): Max number of agent steps.
  - `response_model` (dict): Optional schema for structured output.
  
  ```python
  session.run_task("Scroll to the bottom and click 'Next'")
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="goto" type="method">
  Navigates the browser to a specific URL.
  ```python
  session.goto("https://example.com")
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="evaluate_js" type="method">
  Evaluates JavaScript code in the browser context.
  ```python
  session.evaluate_js("() => document.title")
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="extract" type="method">
  Performs a structured extraction from the current page state.
  ```python
  session.extract(schema={"properties": {"price": {"type": "number"}}})
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="result" type="method">
  Returns the final summary of the session. 
  
  <Note>
    Can only be called **after** the session is closed (e.g., outside the `with` block).
  </Note>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="recording_url" type="method">
  Returns the URL of the video recording.
  
  <Note>
    Can only be called **after** the session is closed.
  </Note>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="downloads_url" type="method">
  Returns the URL of the archive containing any files downloaded.
  
  <Note>
    Can only be called **after** the session is closed.
  </Note>
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="profile_id()" type="method">
  Returns ID of the session.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="live_url()" type="method">
  Returns a live URL where you can interact with the browser (requires `live_view=True`).

  Set `interactive=True` to get an interactive view. 
  
  Set `embed=True` to get an embeddable view (ideal for iframes).
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="live_id()" type="method">
  Returns the live ID for the browser session. It can be passed to `.close_session` to close the session and save the browser profile.
</ResponseField>

## Close a browser session

To close a live browser session, simply call `.close_session`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from smooth import SmoothClient

smooth_client = SmoothClient(api_key="cmzr-YOUR_API_KEY")

...  # open session

smooth_client.close_session(sesion_handle.live_id())
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If the browser session is not manually closed, the profile is saved automatically when the 5 minutes time limit is reached.
</Note>
