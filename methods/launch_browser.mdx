## What are Sessions?

Sessions allow you to persist cookies and authentication across runs.
Once a session is created, it can be utilized for running agent tasks that require user authentication.

1. **Create a Session**
Open a new session. The system will return a session_id (a unique identifier for your session) and a live_url (an interactive browser window).
2. **Authenticate via the Live URL**
Use the provided live_url to log in to the target platform (e.g., your project management tool, social media account) as you normally would. This action securely stores your authentication cookies within the session.
3. **Execute Tasks with the Session ID**
When running an agent task, simply include the session_id. The agent will use the stored authentication from that session, allowing it to immediately access the platform as a logged-in user.
