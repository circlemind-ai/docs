## Introduction

The CircleMind REST API allows you to interact with our platform programmatically. You can use the API to perform various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.

### Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.circlemind.co/
```

### Authentication

The API uses api key authentication. You need to include your API key in the `apiKey` header of each request:

```
apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Request and Response Format

All requests and responses are in JSON format. Make sure to set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` for requests that include a body (unless otherwise specified).

### Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. A 2xx status code indicates success, while a 4xx or 5xx status code indicates an error. The response body will include an error message with more details.

### Example Request

Here is an example of a request to fetch the list of your graphs:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.circlemind.co/list_graphs" -H "apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
