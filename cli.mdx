## The Problem

AI agents like Claude Code are powerful, but they're mostly stuck in the terminal. Meanwhile, most valuable work happens in the browser.

Current browser tools for agents (like `--chrome`, Playwright MCP, agent-browser) all make the same mistake: **they expose low-level actions like click, type, and scroll.** This forces your agent to think about button positions instead of your actual goals.

This creates three problems:

| Problem | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Slow & expensive** | Using a massive model to click buttons is wasteful. Every action costs tokens and time. |
| **Context pollution** | Every click and keystroke fills up the context window with UI noise instead of your task. |
| **Wrong expertise** | General-purpose models aren't trained to handle iframes, shadow DOMs, and the messy reality of websites. |

## The Solution

Smooth CLI is a browser built for AI agents. Instead of exposing hundreds of low-level tools, it gives agents a simple natural language interface.

**Your agent says what it wants. Smooth figures out how to do it.**

  <Card title="20x faster" icon="bolt">
    A specialized model handles the clicking so your agent can focus on thinking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="5x cheaper" icon="piggy-bank">
    Stop using 1T+ params models and burning tokens on UI navigation.

  <Card title="Use your IP" icon="house-signal">
    Route traffic through your machine to avoid captchas and access geo-restricted content.

  <Card title="Unlimited browsers" icon="browsers">
    Launch as many parallel browsers as needed, on-demand.

    No setup, no configuration. Browsers run in the cloud, ready instantly.

## How It Works

Instead of this:
```
click(x=342, y=128)
type("search query")
click(x=401, y=130)
scroll(down=500)
click(x=220, y=340)
... (50 more steps)
```

Your agent just says:
```
"Search for flights from NYC to LA and find the cheapest option"
```

The agent thinks about your goals. Smooth handles the browser.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    ```bash
    pip install smooth-py
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your API key">
    Get your API key from [app.smooth.sh](https://app.smooth.sh), then run:
    ```bash
    smooth config --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to your agent">
    ```bash
    npx skills add https://github.com/circlemind-ai/smooth-sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give your agent a task">
    Ask your agent to do something on the web. It will use Smooth automatically.

    ```
    Find a one-way flight from London to NY leaving tomorrow
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** You can also give your agent complex goals. Our skill will teach your agent how to break them into subtasks and distribute them across multiple concurrent browser sessions automatically.
