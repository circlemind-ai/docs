The Circlemind Python SDK provides a convenient interface to manage and query memories directly from Python applications. With this SDK, you can store, configure, and retrieve contextual information in the form of "memories" using simple method calls.

---

## Key Features

- **Memory Management**: Add and retrieve memories with unique IDs.
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Query stored memories to retrieve relevant results.
- **Custom Configuration**: Set up a your graph configuration to tailor the memory system to specific needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the SDK**
    ```bash
    pip install circlemind
    ```

2. **Configure the Credentials**

    Circlemind requires an API key. If you don't have an API key, you can request one by emailing us at `support@circlemind.co`

    Once you have an API key, export it as an environment variable in your terminal.

    ```
    export CIRCLEMINDSDK_API_KEY_HEADER="your_api_key_here"
    ```

2. **Initialize the Client**

    To start using the Circlemind SDK, initialize the `Circlemind` class.

    ```python
    from circlemind import Circlemind

    client = Circlemind()
    ```

3. **Basic Usage**
    - **Add a Memory**
      ```python
      client.add(memory="Remember to check the project status")
      ```

    - **Query Memories**
      ```python
      results = client.query(query="Show recent reminders")
      print(results)
      ```
