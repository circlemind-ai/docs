Before querying data, make sure to [configure the API key in your environment](/essentials/getting-started#getting-started).

**In the current Beta version, memories are eventually consistent.** 
Memories may not be available for querying for **up to 10 minutes** after adding them for the first time. We will soon release an update that will eliminate this limitation. Following this update, ingestion will be almost instantaneous. If you would like to request earlier access to this new feature, reach out at `support@circlemind.co`.   

You can query a graph by using the `query` method.

```python
  from circlemind import Circlemind

  # Initialize the client
  client = Circlemind()

  # Query the memories
  res = client.query(
    query="Where does Sophie like to hike?",
    graph_id="customer-id-123"
  )

  print(res.response)
```

The `graph_id` is an optional parameter. If not set, it defaults to the `default` graph.

The `res.response` will be a natural language response to your query.

### Include references
With the keyword `with_references`, it is possible to include the references to the sources used to generate an answer.
These sources can be then injected into the answer with the function `.format_references`.

```python
  from circlemind import Circlemind

  # Initialize the client
  client = Circlemind()

  # Query the memories
  res = client.query(
    query="Where does Sophie like to hike?",
    graph_id="customer-id-123",
    with_references=True
  )

  answer, references = res.format_references()
  print(answer)  # Sophie likes to hike on the Alps [1]
  print(references)  # {'1': {<metadata>}}
  
```

It is possible to provide custom formatting when injecting the references by passing a custom replacing function to `.format_references` (the default being `lambda i, _: f"[{i}]"`).
For example, assuming each memory's metadata contains a URL, we can provide markdown formatting with links to the sources used.

```python
  answer, references = res.format_references(
    lambda i, metadata: f"[{i}]({metadata['url']})"
  )
  print(answer)  # Sophie likes to hike on the Alps [1](https://people/profiles/sophie/preferences)
```

where `i` is an incremental index automatically generated for each source used.
