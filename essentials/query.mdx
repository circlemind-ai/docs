Before querying data, make sure to [configure the API key in your environment](/essentials/getting-started#getting-started).

**In the current Beta version, memories are eventually consistent.** 
Memories may not be available for querying for **up to 10 minutes** after adding them for the first time. We will soon release an update that will eliminate this limitation. Following this update, ingestion will be almost instantaneous. If you would like to request earlier access to this new feature, reach out at `support@circlemind.co`.   

You can query a graph by using the `query` method.

```python
  from circlemind import Circlemind

  # Initialize the client
  client = Circlemind()

  # Query the memories
  res = client.query(
    query="Where does Sophie like to hike?",
    graph_id="customer-id-123"
  )

  print(res)
```

The `graph_id` is an optional parameter. If not set, it defaults to the `default` graph.

The `res` response will be a natural language response to your query.
