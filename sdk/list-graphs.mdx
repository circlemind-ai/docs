Before using the client, make sure to [configure the API key in your environment](/essentials/getting-started#getting-started).

You can list your graphs using the `list_graphs` method.

```python
  from circlemind import Circlemind

  # Initialize the client
  client = Circlemind()

  # Query the memories
  graphs = client.list_graphs()

  for graph_id in graphs:
    print(graph_id)
```

The `res` response will be a list of graph ids.
