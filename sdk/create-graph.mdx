Configuring the graph correctly is one of the **most important** steps to guarantee high-quality data representations. We are currently supporting all our beta users during their onboarding. 

To request assistance with your configuration, we highly recommend reaching out to `support@circlemind.co`.

Before using the client, make sure to [configure the API key in your environment](/essentials/getting-started#getting-started).

You can create a graph by using the `create_graph` method.

```python
  from circlemind import Circlemind

  # Initialize the client
  client = Circlemind()

  # Create the graph
  client.create_graph(
    graph_id="customer-id-123",
    domain="Analyze this story and identify the characters, how they interact with each other, the locations they explore, and their relationships. Focus on magical objects and how they are used.",
    example_queries=[
        "Who is Harry’s family?",
        "Which places did Hermione visit?",
        "Who went to Diagon Alley?",
        "Who is in charge of the wizard monetary system?",
        "Who is Harry’s mentor?",
        "What does the relationship between Harry and the Dursleys look like?",
        "Who are Harry’s enemies?",
        "Who are Harry’s close friends?",
        "What does the Sorcerer's Stone do?"
    ],
    entity_types=[
        "Character",
        "Creature",
        "Place",
        "Object",
        "Activity",
        "Faction",
        "Spell"
    ]
  )
```
