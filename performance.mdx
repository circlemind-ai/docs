## WebVoyager

Smooth is the most accurate browser agent on WebVoyager while also being 5x faster and 7x cheaper than Browser Use.

![Benchmarks: Smooth achieves 92% accuracy while also being 5x faster and 7x cheaper than browser use](images/benchmarks.png)

## Alternatives

We found that existing solutions are:

- **Too expensive** Usually require large models - can easily end up costing a few dollars even for simple tasks.
- **Too slow** Can take way too long to complete - e.g. 4 min to book a flight.
- **Unreliable** Even when provided with detailed instructions, they can struggle to complete the task.

![Live comparison showing Smooth taking 56s, $0.05, and succeeding vs Browser Use taking 3 min 48s, $0.20, and failing](images/comparison.gif)

The ultimate test is trying first-hand. We encourage you to try Smooth for free in our [Playground](https://app.smooth.sh).
